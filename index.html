<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<h4>CRUST</h4>

<ul>
<li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs OR zwieback crumbs</li>
<li>1/4 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
<li>5 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon (1/3 cup) melted butter</li>
<li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<h4>FILLING</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 cups (2 large packages) cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
</ul>
<h4>TOPPING (OPTIONAL)</h4>
<ul >
  <li>12 ounce bag frozen raspberries, a scant 3 cups</li>
<li>1 to 3 tablespoons sugar, to taste</li>
<li>1 to 2 tablespoons Pie Filling Enhancer; use 1 tablespoon for a looser sauce, 2 tablespoons for thicker</li>
<li>pinch of ground cinnamon, optional</li>
</ul>  
  
<h3>Method:</h3> 

<ol>
<li>Select a pie pan whose inside top dimension is at least 9", and whose height is at least 1 1/4". Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
<li>Make the crust by stirring together all of the crust ingredients, mixing until thoroughly combined.</li>
<li>Press the crumbs into the bottom and up the sides of the pie pan, making a thicker layer on the bottom than on the sides.</li>
<li>Make the filling by mixing together the room-temperature cream cheese and sugar until smooth. Mix in the eggs and vanilla, again mixing until smooth. To avoid beating too much air into the batter, use a mixer set at low-medium speed. To avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is softened, and/or at room temperature.</li>
<li>Set the pie pan onto a baking sheet, if desired; this makes it easier to transport in and out of the oven, and also protects the bottom of the crust from any potential scorching. Pour the filling into the crust.</li>
<li>Place the cheesecake in the oven. Bake it for 20 minutes, then add a crust shield; or shield the crust with strips of aluminum foil. Bake for an additional 10 minutes (for a total of about 30 minutes). An instant-read thermometer inserted into the crust 1" from the edge should read between 165°F and 170°F; the filling won't look entirely set in the center.</li>
<li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven, and set it on a rack to cool while you make the topping. Once the cake is cool, refrigerate it, covered, until you're ready to serve it.</li>
<li>To make the topping, place the frozen raspberries in a bowl to thaw. You can hasten the process with a quick trip through the microwave, but don't let the berries cook.</li>
<li>Add 1 tablespoon Pie Filling Enhancer, and stir until well combined. Is the topping as thick as you like? If not, stir in another tablespoon Pie Filling Enhancer.</li>
<li>Add 1 to 2 tablespoons granulated sugar, to taste. Stir in a pinch of ground cinnamon, if desired.</li>
<li>Spoon the topping over the cheesecake, and cut slices to serve. Alternatively, cut slices, and top each with a dollop of topping.</li>
</ol>
